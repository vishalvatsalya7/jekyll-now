I recently did an assignment of CS231n stanford course where I was required to derive the gradients for backward pass of Batch Normalization. In this blog post, I will try to explain how I derived the desired gradients from scratch.
So, first I will go through the algorithm of Batch Normalization and how to perform the forward pass with the implementation in Python.
